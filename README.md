# ich_lerne_deutsch
This is a simple package for building German vocabulary. It imeplements several different exercises for recalling wor ddefinitions, noun genders, plural forms and Partizip 2 of verbs. 
The word lists are completely customisable and editable. I have provided a few already of A1 level nouns verbs and adjectives and adverbs. Much of this is borrowed from [here](https://github.com/patsytau/anki_german_a1_vocab). Thank you Patsy.

## Installation
### Install Ananconda
Install anaconda or miniconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/). The rest of the installation and running the app will require you to use either the computer terminal (on Mac/Linux) or the 'Anaconda prompt' on Windows. The Anaconda prompt will have been installed when you installed Anaconda.
